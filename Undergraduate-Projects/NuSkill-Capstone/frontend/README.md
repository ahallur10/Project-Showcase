# Frontend (illustrative)
This folder contains **sample React components** to demonstrate the UI slice:
- `AuthForm.jsx` – email/password login
- `DepositWidget.jsx` – create a (mock) deposit intent and open a pay URL
- `ProgressTracker.jsx` – post tutorial progress and trigger refund when complete

> These files are illustrative for reviewers; they are not a full React app.
