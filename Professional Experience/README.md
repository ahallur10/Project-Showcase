# Professional Experience Portfolio

<p>
This folder showcases key data analytics and machine learning projects I developed during my tenure as a Data Analyst at Maricopa County. These projects demonstrate end-to-end solutions spanning predictive modeling, business intelligence and automated reporting that directly supported operational decision-making

## 🎯 Project Summaries

### 1. [At-Risk Prediction Model](./At-Risk%20Prediction%20Model/)
**Machine Learning | Python | scikit-learn | PyTorch**

Directed the division's first machine learning model to predict which students (ages 0–5) are at risk of not meeting developmental milestones. This predictive system enables early intervention by analyzing patterns across attendance, health, and other student information.

**Key Achievements:**
- Built and validated models achieving **86% accuracy** (Neural Network) and **78% accuracy** (Decision Tree)
- Implemented K-Fold Cross Validation and SMOTE for robust, balanced predictions
- Created a foundation for future implementation, progressing in planned phases
- Visualized predictions in Power BI for educators

**Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, SMOTE, Power BI

### 2. [Health Requirement Dashboard](./Health%20Requirement%20Dashboard/)
**Power BI | SQL Server | DAX | Power Query**

Centralized monitoring system for medical and developmental health requirements across 30+ Head Start sites. Replaced hours of manual report-running with instant, drill-down analytics that reduced coordinator workload by **80–90%**.

**Key Achievements:**
- Reverse-engineered complex status logic (Complete, Incomplete, Past Due) without vendor documentation
- Built ELT pipeline connecting SQL Server and SharePoint for dynamic lookups
- Reduced daily monitoring from **2–3 hours to 10–15 minutes** (~30–50 hours saved monthly)
- Designed audit-friendly dashboard matching official report totals

**Tech Stack:** Power BI, SQL Server, DAX, Power Query (M), SharePoint

### 3. [Supply Order Dashboard](./Supply%20Order%20Dashboard/)
**Power BI | SQL Server | ELT | Data Modeling**

Automated supply order tracking and analysis system consolidating 4 order types (Classroom, Office, Janitorial, Diapering) across all sites. Replaced manual spreadsheets with a unified dashboard for purchasing decisions.

**Key Achievements:**
- Unified 4 disparate supply order tables into a single analytical model
- Created custom mapping system linking backend codes to user-friendly item names
- Standardized 15–19 transformation steps per table for consistent data quality
- Enabled data-driven insights into item demand, fulfillment trends, and site-level spending

**Tech Stack:** Power BI, SQL Server, DAX, Power Query (M), SharePoint
