The Health Requirements Dashboard centralizes monitoring of medical and developmental health requirements for Head Start and Early Head Start students. Previously, the health coordinator's relied on multiple ChildPlus reports, re-running filters repeatedly and manually highlighting results which often resulted in working after hours. This dashboard replicates the database validation logic in Power BI and brings all requirements, programs, students and statuses into one place, enabling instant drilldowns by site, program, status, and requirement. 

**Impact:**  
- **Hours â†’ minutes**: monitoring sessions reduced from multi-hour report runs to quick checks.  
- ***80â€“90%* less manual work**: eliminated repeated report runs or manual tallies/highlighting.
- **Audit-friendly**: Built in the manner which matches numbers if run manually using database reports, ensuring consistency and reliability
